# pwa_starting_point

This repository contains the starting code for the making a PWA Workshop.  This basic node app has three pages with minimal functionality that will be expanded on throughout the workshop.  

The application is run using the command "npm start"  and can be viewed on localhost:8080.  

We will be adding the following to this code base in order to allow for mobile use:
  - A service worker (sw.js)
    - cache
    - Fetch and Install methods
  - main.js
    - loads and registers the service worker
  - manifest.json
    - specifies attribiutes of app
